// NOTE: This old network implementation used Burn framework
// We've migrated to tch-rs (PyTorch) for SAC implementation
// See: rust-mlagents/rl_core/src/trainers/sac/networks/ for current implementation

// This file is kept for historical reference only
// All code removed - network implementations are now in trainers/sac/networks/
